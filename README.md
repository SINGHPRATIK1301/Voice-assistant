Hi, guys I am PRATIK SINGH currently a beginner in python.As a beginner in Python, I've been exploring the exciting world of voice assistants. 
It's been a challenging but rewarding experience to learn how to create these AI-powered tools. 
I've recently built a basic voice assistant that can perform tasks like searching for information, setting reminders, playing music and many more things. 
It's still a work in progress, but I'm excited to see where this journey takes me. 
If you're interested in learning more about Python or voice assistants, feel free to reach out or share your experiences in the comments.
